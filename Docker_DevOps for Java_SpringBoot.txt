1. Install Docker

I encountered error when starting up Docker. The error read:


Hardware assisted virtualization and data execution protection must be enabled in the BIOS. See https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/troubleshoot/#virtualization

This can be fixed in BIOS setup. Thankfully, I came across this blog post and I quickly resolved my the issue. https://nerdschalk.com/how-to-enable-virtualization-in-bios-on-windows-11-or-10/. 
Take a look at that if you ever encounter the same issue. :)

2. Docker Usecase
-------------------------------
From the command prompt:

- Use docker --version to check Docker version. Ensure that it is 19 and above
- Run: docker run in28min/todo-rest-api-h2:1.0.0.RELEASE
  - pull from registry 
  - Spring Boot app launched
  - new manner in which application will be installed
- image is downloaded to machine and run as an application
- image = static version; bytes
- container - running version of your image/object
- check port on which it is running (i.e. port 5000), if site can't be reached, provide option
  - docker run -p 5000:5000 in28min/todo-rest-api-h2:1.0.0.RELEASE
  - -p 5000:5000 => -p {HostPort}:{ContainerPort}
  - mapping container port to host port - bridge network
  - run localhost:5000/hello-world in browser
