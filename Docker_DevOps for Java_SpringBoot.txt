1. Install Docker

I encountered error when starting up Docker. The error read:


Hardware assisted virtualization and data execution protection must be enabled in the BIOS. See https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/troubleshoot/#virtualization

This can be fixed in BIOS setup. Thankfully, I came across this blog post and I quickly resolved my the issue. https://nerdschalk.com/how-to-enable-virtualization-in-bios-on-windows-11-or-10/. 
Take a look at that if you ever encounter the same issue

2. Docker Usecase
-------------------------------
From the command prompt:

- Use docker --version to check Docker version. Ensure that it is 19 and above
- docker run neodevops/todo-rest-api-h2:1.0.0.RELEASE
